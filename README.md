<h1>Installation</h1>

<h4>Prerequisites:</h4>

- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) - Developed with Version 21, lower versions may work but are untested
- If you plan to use the database, ensure you have access to the cloud

<h4> Steps:</h4>

- Download the master branch, and ensure it's unzipped
- Navigate via the appropriate CLI for your system to "I2P-Assignment\target\classes"
- Run "java -cp . uni.S257123.main.InventoryManagementSystem"

<h1>Notes:</h1>
- Developed using Intellij Idea, if you want the console ui to look smooth in the integrated console, lowering the line spacing in the settings enables it to look more like powershell. Even if you don't it'll look fine when run from the console
- Project dependencies are handled by Maven
